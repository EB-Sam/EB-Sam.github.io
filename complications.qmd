Unfortunately, it is difficult find reliable and accessible data on complications and unsafe abortions. Several factors may contribute to this lack of information. Initially, data was sought for miscarriage rates variation by state, how unsafe abortion rates evolved over time, illegal abortion rates, and data on women whose lives were endangered by the inability to access safe abortion services. However, these datasets either do not exist or are difficult to locate.

Many elements might be responsible for this dearth of information. It may, for instance, be difficult or unrealistic to report on all miscarriages. Furthermore, there are stringent regulations surrounding all research done on pregnant women for obvious reasons. Data on unsafe or illegal abortions might not exists because these procedures may go unreported. However, the absence of these data sets is telling in and of itself, and is an issue for women's health and public health on the whole regardless of political perspective or affiliation.
