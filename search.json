In contrast, as policies become more restrictive, there is an apparent increase in the proportion of states categorized as “unhealthy” or “below average.” This suggests that states with restrictive abortion policies are not only limiting access to reproductive healthcare but may also be falling behind in fostering broader public health outcomes. These restrictive states disproportionately represent environments where overall health conditions are poorer, potentially reflecting a lack of investment in comprehensive healthcare systems or preventative care infrastructure.\nAlternatively, states with protective abortion policies appear to align with stronger public health systems, where access to care and preventative measures may contribute to better overall health rankings. This pattern underscores a broader connection between policy decisions prioritizing individual health rights and the overall well-being of a population.\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis Test: captures difference in overall_healths numeric rankings\n\nkruskal_test &lt;- kruskal.test(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nprint(kruskal_test)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  overall_health_ranking by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 23.649, df = 6, p-value = 0.0006058\n\n\nCode\n# If Kruskal-Wallis is significant, run pairwise Wilcoxon tests \npairwise.wilcox.test(df$overall_health_ranking,\n                     df$abortion_policies, p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n    Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum exact test \n\ndata:  df$overall_health_ranking and df$abortion_policies \n\n                              most protective very protective protective\nvery protective               1.0000          -               -         \nprotective                    1.0000          1.0000          -         \nsome restrictions/protections 1.0000          1.0000          1.0000    \nrestrictive                   1.0000          1.0000          1.0000    \nvery restrictive              1.0000          0.8909          0.5035    \nmost restrictive              0.6165          0.0946          0.0034    \n                              some restrictions/protections restrictive\nvery protective               -                             -          \nprotective                    -                             -          \nsome restrictions/protections -                             -          \nrestrictive                   1.0000                        -          \nvery restrictive              1.0000                        1.0000     \nmost restrictive              1.0000                        0.4437     \n                              very restrictive\nvery protective               -               \nprotective                    -               \nsome restrictions/protections -               \nrestrictive                   -               \nvery restrictive              -               \nmost restrictive              1.0000          \n\nP value adjustment method: bonferroni \n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis Test (χ² = 23.649, df = 6, p = 0.0006058) reveals statistically significant differences in the numeric overall health rankings across the seven levels of abortion policy restrictiveness. This suggests that abortion policy restrictiveness correlates with variations in health outcomes. The low p-value (&lt; 0.05) indicates that these differences are unlikely to have occurred by chance. This result supports the observation from the stacked bar plot: more restrictive abortion policies tend to align with poorer health outcomes, while more protective policies are associated with better health outcomes.\n\n\nCode\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\ninstall.packages(\"clinfun\")\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/zl/mwx636ts1pbc006v4wqp6fwr0000gn/T//Rtmp9qiE9b/downloaded_packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(clinfun)\n\n# First, check sample sizes in each group\ntable(df$abortion_policies)\n\n\n\n              most protective               very protective \n                            2                             7 \n                   protective some restrictions/protections \n                           10                             5 \n                  restrictive              very restrictive \n                            7                             4 \n             most restrictive \n                           16 \n\n\nCode\n# Run Jonckheere-Terpstra test\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$overall_health_ranking, \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"increasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 806.5, p-value = 1e-04\nalternative hypothesis: increasing\n\n\nNow we will perform linear regression to investigate the direction of this relationship. Before doing so, we must check assumptions:\n\n\nCode\n# Assumptions: \nlibrary(lmtest)\n\n\nLoading required package: zoo\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'zoo'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    as.Date, as.Date.numeric\n\n\nCode\nprocessed_data &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_ranking = mean(overall_health_ranking, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# 1.

Since the heteroscedasticity test yields. p-value of 0.245, there is no significant evidence to suggest this data violates the homoscedasticity assumption. The qq-plot and histogram indicate that the data is, for the most part, approximately Normal, but the small sample size is likely the main factor impacting the strange shape of the histogram. Nevertheless, we assume that none of these slight deviations are extreme enough to violate the assumption, so we can continue with our linear regression:\nNull hypothesis: the mean overall health ranking is the same in each level of abortion policy.\nAlternative hypothesis: at least one abortion policy group has a significantly different effect on the mean overall health ranking.\n\n\nCode\n# Linear Regression\nprocessed_data &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(abortion_policies) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_ranking = mean(overall_health_ranking, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Fit linear model to calculate R-squared\nlm_model &lt;- lm(avg_ranking ~ as.numeric(abortion_policies), data = processed_data)\nr_squared &lt;- round(summary(lm_model)$r.squared, 3)\n\n# Plot with R-squared annotation\nggplot(processed_data, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = avg_ranking)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Overall Health Ranking\",\n       x = \"Abortion Policy\",\n       y = \"Ranking\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", \n           x = length(levels(processed_data$abortion_policies)) - 0.5, \n           y = max(processed_data$avg_ranking), \n           label = paste0(\"R² = \", r_squared),\n           size = 5, \n           color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), \n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14))\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a p-value of 0.0006981, this linear regression model provides significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative and suggest that at least one level of abortion policy has a significant inclufence on the overall health ranking. This linear regression plot shows a strong, positive relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and overall health ranking. As abortion policies become more restrictive (moving from “most protective” to “most restrictive”), the overall health ranking worsens (increases numerically). The R² value of 0.917 indicates that 91.7% of the variation in overall health ranking is explained by the level of restrictiveness in abortion policies. This suggests a clear and significant trend where stricter abortion policies are associated with poorer overall health outcomes.\nMISSING PERMUTATION TEST\n\n\nMedicaid Expansion Status by Abortion Policy\n\n\nCode\ndf$medicaid_expansion &lt;- factor(df$medicaid_expansion_status, levels = c(\"0\", \"1\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot of Medicaid Expansion Status with Abortion Policies as Fill\nggplot(df, aes(x = medicaid_expansion, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Medicaid Expansion Status\", \n    y = \"Proportion\", \n    fill = \"Abortion Policy\",\n    title = \"Proportion of Abortion Policies by Medicaid Expansion Status\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"Not Expanded\", \"1\" = \"Expanded\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot highlights how states that have not expanded Medicaid are disproportionately associated with more restrictive abortion policies. In contrast, states that have expanded Medicaid show a higher proportion of protective and less restrictive abortion policies. This pattern suggests a potential relationship between policy choices around healthcare access (Medicaid expansion) and reproductive rights (abortion policies), where more progressive health policies align with broader healthcare access.\n\n\nCode\n# Fisher's Exact Test\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$medicaid_expansion_status, df$abortion_policies)\n\nfisher_test_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.03091\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nThe Fisher’s Exact Test yielded a p-value of 0.03091, indicating a statistically significant association between Medicaid expansion status and abortion policies. This suggests that the distribution of Medicaid expansion (expanded vs. not expanded) varies significantly across different abortion policy categories. States’ decisions on Medicaid expansion may align with their stance on abortion policies.\nNow we will perform logistic regression to investigate the direction of this relationship, since our dependent variable is a binary categorical variable:\n\n\nCode\n# Check assumptions for logistic regression \ntable(df$medicaid_expansion_status, df$abortion_policies)\n\n\n   \n    most protective very protective protective some restrictions/protections\n  0               0               0          0                             0\n  1               2               7         10                             5\n   \n    restrictive very restrictive most restrictive\n  0           3                1                7\n  1           4                3                9\n\n\nSample sizes for logistic regression are too small, so we must use exact logistic regression to account for this size and separation:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(logistf)\n\n# Fit the exact logistic regression model\nfit &lt;- logistf(medicaid_expansion_status ~ factor(abortion_policies), data = df)\n\nsummary(fit)\n\n\nlogistf(formula = medicaid_expansion_status ~ factor(abortion_policies), \n    data = df)\n\nModel fitted by Penalized ML\nCoefficients:\n                                                             coef se(coef)\n(Intercept)                                             1.6094379 1.549193\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective                1.0986123 2.129163\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                     1.4350845 2.120198\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections  0.7884574 2.140518\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   -1.3581235 1.705267\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              -0.7621401 1.830951\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              -1.3730491 1.624376\n                                                       lower 0.95 upper 0.95\n(Intercept)                                            -0.8993577   6.536132\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               -4.2449368   6.453876\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                    -3.8986862   6.781282\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections -4.5677245   6.155104\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   -6.4096451   1.555766\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              -5.9125654   2.600042\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              -6.3586197   1.327338\n                                                           Chisq         p\n(Intercept)                                            1.4555158 0.2276449\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               0.2579603 0.6115249\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                    0.4335919 0.5102317\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections 0.1335787 0.7147500\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   0.7522045 0.3857792\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              0.1853520 0.6668136\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              0.8859352 0.3465812\n                                                       method\n(Intercept)                                                 2\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective                    2\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                         2\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections      2\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                        2\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive                   2\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive                   2\n\nMethod: 1-Wald, 2-Profile penalized log-likelihood, 3-None\n\nLikelihood ratio test=10.87201 on 6 df, p=0.09241346, n=51\nWald test = 12.68851 on 6 df, p = 0.04825799\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Generate predicted probabilities\ndf$predicted_prob &lt;- predict(fit, type = \"response\")\n\n# visualize\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = predicted_prob)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), alpha = 0.6) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"Predicted Probability\",\n       title = \"Medicaid Expansion Status \\nPredicted Probabilities by Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact logistic regression model yields a p-value of 0.0483 from the Wald test, indicating that abortion policies are significantly associated with Medicaid expansion status. The slope coefficients suggest that as abortion policies become more restrictive, the predicted probability of Medicaid expansion decreases. The visualization reinforces this relationship, showing higher predicted probabilities of Medicaid expansion among states with protective abortion policies and sharply lower probabilities in states with restrictive abortion policies. This pattern highlights a critical divide in policy decisions: states prioritizing broader reproductive rights are also more likely to expand healthcare access through Medicaid, whereas restrictive abortion policies align with reduced Medicaid expansion. This underscores the broader policy implications of prioritizing access to healthcare and reproductive rights.\n\n\nCoverage, Access, and Affordability by Abortion Policy\n\n\nCode\n# Boxplot for coverage and abortion policies\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = coverage_access_and_affordability, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n    y = \"Coverage Access and Affordability\", \n    fill = \"Abortion Policies\",\n    title = \"Coverage Access and Affordability by Abortion Policies\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nStates with “most protective” abortion policies tend to have better rankings (lower values), indicating higher coverage access and affordability. Conversely, states with more restrictive abortion policies exhibit worse rankings (higher values), suggesting reduced coverage access and affordability. This trend may reflect that states with protective abortion policies prioritize healthcare equity and access more effectively than those with restrictive policies.\nThis disparity also highlights inconsistencies in the priorities of restrictive states. States with protective abortion policies might integrate reproductive healthcare into broader healthcare initiatives, fostering better access and affordability. In contrast, restrictive states, which often frame their policies as being “pro-life,” may focus on generalized or inconsistent healthcare frameworks, leading to poorer outcomes. The lack of affordable and accessible healthcare in these states undermines their claims to protect life, as they fail to support the broader well-being of the populations they govern. These findings underscore both the interconnectedness between reproductive healthcare policy and overall healthcare accessibility and affordability, and the disconnect in restrictive states between policy rhetoric and actionable support for healthier communities.\n\n\nCode\nkruskal_test &lt;- kruskal.test(coverage_access_and_affordability ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nprint(kruskal_test)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  coverage_access_and_affordability by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 22.583, df = 6, p-value = 0.0009489\n\n\nCode\n# If Kruskal-Wallis is significant, run pairwise Wilcoxon tests \npairwise.wilcox.test(df$coverage_access_and_affordability,\n                     df$abortion_policies, p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n    Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum exact test \n\ndata:  df$coverage_access_and_affordability and df$abortion_policies \n\n                              most protective very protective protective\nvery protective               1.00            -               -         \nprotective                    1.00            1.00            -         \nsome restrictions/protections 1.00            1.00            1.00      \nrestrictive                   1.00            1.00            0.46      \nvery restrictive              1.00            0.25            0.12      \nmost restrictive              0.27            0.12            0.03      \n                              some restrictions/protections restrictive\nvery protective               -                             -          \nprotective                    -                             -          \nsome restrictions/protections -                             -          \nrestrictive                   1.00                          -          \nvery restrictive              1.00                          1.00       \nmost restrictive              1.00                          1.00       \n                              very restrictive\nvery protective               -               \nprotective                    -               \nsome restrictions/protections -               \nrestrictive                   -               \nvery restrictive              -               \nmost restrictive              1.00            \n\nP value adjustment method: bonferroni \n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yielded a chi-squared value of 22.583 with 6 degrees of freedom and a p of 0.0009489. This statistically significant result indicates that there are differences in coverage access and affordability rankings among the seven abortion policy levels. States with more restrictive abortion policies appear to have higher (worse) rankings for coverage access and affordability compared to states with more protective policies, reinforcing the association between policy restrictiveness and reduced access to affordable care.\n\n\nCode\n# Run Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$coverage_access_and_affordability, \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"increasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 763.5, p-value = 1e-04\nalternative hypothesis: increasing\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test Implementation for Coverage Access and Affordability\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(coverage_access_and_affordability ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$coverage_access_and_affordability &lt;- sample(permuted_data$coverage_access_and_affordability)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(coverage_access_and_affordability ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 6.089754 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 1e-04 \n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nA permutation test was performed on this data in addition to the Kruskal-Wallis test to ensure the robustness of the findings across different methods. The observed F-statistic of 6.089754 (indicated by the red dashed line) lies far to the right of the permutation distribution, representing F-statistics generated under the null hypothesis. The permutation test produced a statistically significant p-value of 1x10^-4, providing strong evidence that the observed differences in coverage access and affordability across abortion policy levels are unlikely to be due to random chance. This result supports the conclusion that coverage access and affordability rankings vary significantly by abortion policy level.\n\n\nPrescription Contraception Coverage Requirements by Abortion Policy\n\n\nCode\ndf$requires_prescription &lt;- factor(df$state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception, levels = c(\"0\", \"1\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot for Prescription Contraception Coverage Requirements\nggplot(df, aes(x = requires_prescription, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(x = \"Requires Prescription Coverage\", \n       y = \"Proportion\", \n       fill = \"Abortion Policy\",\n       title = \"Prescription Contraception Coverage Requirements by Abortion Policy\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"Does Not Require\", \"1\" = \"Requires\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 12)) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar plot demonstrates that states that do not require prescription coverage are predominantly associated with more restrictive abortion policies, whereas states that require prescription coverage tend to align with more protective abortion policies.\nThis pattern reveals a significant gap in healthcare priorities among restrictive abortion policy states. By failing to require prescription coverage, particularly for contraceptives, these states not only limit access to essential tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, effectively undermining efforts to reduce the need for abortions in the first place, but also neglect the broader healthcare needs of individuals. Contraceptives are often prescribed to manage health conditions such as dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, or hormonal regulation, which can significantly impact quality of life. States with protective abortion policies, which typically require prescription coverage, demonstrate a more holistic approach to healthcare, supporting both reproductive autonomy and broader health outcomes.\n\n\nCode\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(df$state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception, df$abortion_policies)\nfisher_test_result &lt;- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.01764\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\nThe Fisher’s Exact Test results yield a p-value of 0.01764, indicating a statistically significant association between whether a state requires prescription coverage and its abortion policy. This suggests that the distribution of states requiring or not requiring prescription coverage is not independent of their abortion policy levels. The association highlights how policy decisions in these states may systematically limit or increase access to reproductive healthcare and broader health support systems, reinforcing disparities in healthcare infrastructure and prioritization.\nNow, we will perform logistic regression to investigate the direction of this relationship:\n\n\nCode\n# Check assumptions for logistic regression \ntable(df$state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception, df$abortion_policies)\n\n\n   \n    most protective very protective protective some restrictions/protections\n  0               0               1          1                             1\n  1               2               6          9                             4\n   \n    restrictive very restrictive most restrictive\n  0           4                2               11\n  1           3                2                5\n\n\nSample sizes for logistic regression are too small, so we must use exact logistic regression to account for this size and separation…\n\n\nCode\n# Logistic Regression\nlibrary(logistf)\n\n# Fit logistic regression model\nfit &lt;- logistf(state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception ~ factor(abortion_policies), data = df)\n\n# View results\nsummary(fit)\n\n\nlogistf(formula = state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception ~ \n    factor(abortion_policies), data = df)\n\nModel fitted by Penalized ML\nCoefficients:\n                                                             coef se(coef)\n(Intercept)                                             1.6094379 1.549193\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               -0.1431008 1.794579\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                     0.2363888 1.780990\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections -0.5108256 1.813529\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   -1.8607523 1.705267\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              -1.6094379 1.788854\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              -2.3470369 1.633638\n                                                       lower 0.95 upper 0.95\n(Intercept)                                            -0.8993577  6.5361319\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               -5.2583237  3.1558062\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                    -4.8662731  3.5104202\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections -5.6440931  2.8216151\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   -6.9149344  1.0302498\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              -6.7355228  1.5101927\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              -7.3414344  0.3645081\n                                                             Chisq          p\n(Intercept)                                            1.455515830 0.22764495\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective               0.006456591 0.93595657\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                    0.017133155 0.89585942\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections 0.083322594 0.77284423\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                   1.489808677 0.22224615\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive              0.950172752 0.32967533\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive              2.814056557 0.09344182\n                                                       method\n(Intercept)                                                 2\nfactor(abortion_policies)very protective                    2\nfactor(abortion_policies)protective                         2\nfactor(abortion_policies)some restrictions/protections      2\nfactor(abortion_policies)restrictive                        2\nfactor(abortion_policies)very restrictive                   2\nfactor(abortion_policies)most restrictive                   2\n\nMethod: 1-Wald, 2-Profile penalized log-likelihood, 3-None\n\nLikelihood ratio test=13.07125 on 6 df, p=0.04191838, n=51\nWald test = 11.61987 on 6 df, p = 0.07100654\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Generate predicted probabilities\ndf$predicted_prob &lt;- predict(fit, type = \"response\")\n\n# Visualize predicted probabilities\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = predicted_prob)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), alpha = 0.6) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\",\n       y = \"Predicted Probability\",\n       title = \"Predicted Probability of Prescription Contraceptive Coverage \\nby Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact logistic regression analysis provides evidence of a significant relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and the likelihood of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage, as shown by the likelihood ratio test (p=0.0419). The predicted probabilities visualized here demonstrate a clear gradient: states with more restrictive abortion policies consistently exhibit lower probabilities of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage compared to those with more protective policies.\nThis trend highlights a potential disconnect in restrictive states, which often emphasize policies purportedly in favor of life but fail to mandate coverage for contraceptives that could prevent unintended pregnancies or support broader healthcare needs. On the other hand, states with protective abortion policies are more likely to require coverage, aligning with healthcare frameworks that prioritize both reproductive autonomy and overall well-being. These findings underscore how policy decisions around abortion can reflect broader approaches—or lack thereof—toward supporting individuals’ health and autonomy.\n\n\nHealthcare Quality and Prevention by Abortion Policy\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = health_care_quality_and_prevention, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Health Care Quality and Prevention by Abortion Policies\",\n    x = \"Abortion Policies\",\n    y = \"Health Care Quality and Prevention\",\n    fill = \"Abortion Policies\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nStates with “most protective” abortion policies are clustered at the lower end of the ranking scale, indicating better healthcare quality and prevention outcomes. Conversely, states with “most restrictive” abortion policies show higher rankings, reflecting poorer performance in healthcare quality and prevention metrics. The trend suggests that states with protective abortion policies may prioritize robust healthcare systems, integrating reproductive health within broader preventative and quality-focused frameworks.

States with “most protective” abortion policies demonstrate the best health outcomes, with rankings clustered toward the lower end of the scale. As abortion policies become increasingly restrictive, health outcomes generally worsen, with rankings shifting higher. States with “most restrictive” abortion policies exhibit the poorest health outcomes, with a higher concentration of rankings near the bottom of the boxplot.\nThese trends suggest that states with more restrictive abortion policies may lack broader investments in public health infrastructure and services, contributing to poorer overall health outcomes. In contrast, states with protective abortion policies might prioritize comprehensive healthcare systems that address a wider array of health determinants. This disparity underscores the broader implications of policy decisions on public health and well-being, highlighting potential inequities in access to essential healthcare resources.\n\n\nCode\nkruskal_test &lt;- kruskal.test(health_outcomes ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nprint(kruskal_test)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  health_outcomes by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 21.669, df = 6, p-value = 0.00139\n\n\nCode\n# If Kruskal-Wallis is significant, run pairwise Wilcoxon tests \npairwise.wilcox.test(df$health_outcomes,\n                     df$abortion_policies, p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n    Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum exact test \n\ndata:  df$health_outcomes and df$abortion_policies \n\n                              most protective very protective protective\nvery protective               1.000           -               -         \nprotective                    1.000           1.000           -         \nsome restrictions/protections 1.000           1.000           1.000     \nrestrictive                   1.000           1.000           1.000     \nvery restrictive              1.000           1.000           1.000     \nmost restrictive              1.000           0.076           0.014     \n                              some restrictions/protections restrictive\nvery protective               -                             -          \nprotective                    -                             -          \nsome restrictions/protections -                             -          \nrestrictive                   1.000                         -          \nvery restrictive              1.000                         1.000      \nmost restrictive              0.485                         0.211      \n                              very restrictive\nvery protective               -               \nprotective                    -               \nsome restrictions/protections -               \nrestrictive                   -               \nvery restrictive              -               \nmost restrictive              1.000           \n\nP value adjustment method: bonferroni \n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test for health outcomes across abortion policy levels reveals a chi-squared value of 21.669 with 6 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.00139.

This table serves as a starting point for understanding disparities in healthcare access by abortion policy and underscores the need for more recent and comprehensive data to draw robust conclusions.\nThis boxplot illustrates the ratio of OB-GYNs to women aged 15-44 across states with varying abortion policy classifications. States with more protective abortion policies tend to have higher ratios of OB-GYNs to women, as indicated by the greater median and interquartile ranges for these groups. Conversely, states with more restrictive abortion policies exhibit lower OB-GYN-to-women ratios, reflected in their comparatively lower medians and more compressed distributions.\nThese findings suggest that states prioritizing access to abortion services may also allocate resources to ensure greater availability of OB-GYNs, enhancing access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. On the other hand, states with restrictive abortion policies may not only limit reproductive healthcare access through policy but may also have fewer OB-GYNs available, compounding the barriers for women in accessing necessary medical care.\n\n\nCode\n# First, calculate the observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Perform permutation test\nset.seed(1234) # For reproducibility\nN &lt;- 100000 # Number of permutations\nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$obgyn_per_100k &lt;- sample(permuted_data$obgyn_per_100k) # Fixed assignment\n  \n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(obgyn_per_100k ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate the p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\n# Print results\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 1.683609 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.15428 \n\n\n\n\nCode\nhist(perm_F, \n     main = \"Distribution of F-statistics under Null Hypothesis\",\n     xlab = \"F-statistic\",\n     breaks = 50)\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test for the ratio of OB-GYNs to women aged 15–44 yields an observed F-statistic of 5.608316 with a highly significant p-value of 0.0003.

This accompanying visualization provides us additional insight into the characteristics of this difference(s). As we can see, the maternal mortality rates in the most restrictive abortion policy states have the largest and highest range and the greatest mean mortality rate. The mean mortality rate in the most protective states appears to be the lowest (or tied with the rate in the protective policy states). The visualization shows that for the most part, as the restrictiveness of abortion policy increases, so does the mean maternal mortality rate.\n\n\nCode\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\ninstall.packages(\"clinfun\")\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/zl/mwx636ts1pbc006v4wqp6fwr0000gn/T//RtmpenMXgG/downloaded_packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(clinfun)\n\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$\"maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births\", \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"increasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 545, p-value = 1e-04\nalternative hypothesis: increasing\n\n\nTo further confirm these findings, we will perform a permutation test on the ANOVA mean differences:\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` &lt;- sample(permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births`)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 3.595385 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0067 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test also yields a statistically significant p-value, further providing evidence to suggest a true mean difference in maternal mortality rates among abortion policy groups.\nAbortions are critical for preserving maternal health and mortality. There are many situations in which an abortion is life-saving for the mother. By restricting or banning abortions, more mothers are at risk for maternal mortality by being prohibited or limited in accessing or being treated with necessary measures. If abortions are banned or heavily restricted, it is reasonable to assume that maternal mortality would increase in those states as more women suffer the effects of a complicated or terminal pregnancy without intervention. Additionally, prohibiting abortion forces women who aren’t ready to have babies to give birth, even if they are too young, facing other health risks or problems, or don’t have the financial resources or health insurance to access adequate care during pregnancy, which are all risk factors for maternal mortality.\nWhen states choose to implement the restrictive abortion policies, even with data on maternal mortality in their state, they are consciously establishing conditions that could exacerbate preventable deaths in women."

This accompanying visualization provides us additional insight into the characteristics of this difference(s). As we can see, the maternal mortality rates in the most restrictive abortion policy states have the largest and highest range and the greatest mean mortality rate. The mean mortality rate in the most protective states appears to be the lowest (or tied with the rate in the protective policy states). The visualization shows that for the most part, as the restrictiveness of abortion policy increases, so does the mean maternal mortality rate.\n\n\nCode\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\ninstall.packages(\"clinfun\")\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/zl/mwx636ts1pbc006v4wqp6fwr0000gn/T//RtmpenMXgG/downloaded_packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(clinfun)\n\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$\"maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births\", \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"increasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 545, p-value = 1e-04\nalternative hypothesis: increasing\n\n\nTo further confirm these findings, we will perform a permutation test on the ANOVA mean differences:\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` &lt;- sample(permuted_data$`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births`)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(`maternal_mortality_rates_2020_2022_per_100,000_live births` ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 3.595385 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0067 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test also yields a statistically significant p-value, further providing evidence to suggest a true mean difference in maternal mortality rates among abortion policy groups.\nAbortions are critical for preserving maternal health and mortality. There are many situations in which an abortion is life-saving for the mother. By restricting or banning abortions, more mothers are at risk for maternal mortality by being prohibited or limited in accessing or being treated with necessary measures. If abortions are banned or heavily restricted, it is reasonable to assume that maternal mortality would increase in those states as more women suffer the effects of a complicated or terminal pregnancy without intervention. Additionally, prohibiting abortion forces women who aren’t ready to have babies to give birth, even if they are too young, facing other health risks or problems, or don’t have the financial resources or health insurance to access adequate care during pregnancy, which are all risk factors for maternal mortality.\nWhen states choose to implement the restrictive abortion policies, even with data on maternal mortality in their state, they are consciously establishing conditions that could exacerbate preventable deaths in women."

The boxplot visualization indicates the scope of these differences. The plot demonstrates a clear relationship where as the abortion policy becomes more strict, the higher the mean percentage of women who did not receive care due to it being too expensive for them to afford. It appears that the mean percentage of women going without care in the most protective abortion policy states is about 12%, whereas in the states with the most restrictive abortion policy, the mean is about 18%.\n\n\nCode\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\ninstall.packages(\"clinfun\")\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/zl/mwx636ts1pbc006v4wqp6fwr0000gn/T//RtmpenMXgG/downloaded_packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(clinfun)\n\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$women_18_44_who_went_without_care_because_of_cost, \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"increasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 740.5, p-value = 4e-04\nalternative hypothesis: increasing\n\n\nTo confirm the strength of the difference in means, we will perform a permutation test:\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(women_18_44_who_went_without_care_because_of_cost ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$women_18_44_who_went_without_care_because_of_cost &lt;- sample(permuted_data$women_18_44_who_went_without_care_because_of_cost)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(women_18_44_who_went_without_care_because_of_cost ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 2.329356 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0496 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value produced by the permutation test is 0.496, which is extremely close to the alpha level we are using of 0.05. This p-value suggests that while the likelihood of observing the observed ANOVA test statistic under the null hypothesis is very low, it is not as low as in other tests we’ve seen. It may be more appropriate to say that the permutation test provides moderately strong evidence to suggest that there is a true difference in the mean percentage of women who went without care due to cost in states with different abortion policy levels.\nThese findings highlight how in states that chose to implement restrictive abortion bans, there were already problems with women being unable to access adequate maternal care due to costs. Adding restrictive abortion measures, which has indirect effects on the quality and accessibility of other maternal health resources, would add an extra layer of difficulty to women who need maternal care but aren’t able to afford it."

The boxplots give us some insight into the nature of these differences. Interestingly, the mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy appears to increase as the restrictiveness of abortion policy increases, until the most restrictive level where the mean and range drop significantly. It is difficult to understand why this may be. However, the clear trend among the previous six groups appears to be a significant indicator of the maternal population characteristics of the states in those levels.\n\n\nCode\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\ninstall.packages(\"clinfun\")\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/zl/mwx636ts1pbc006v4wqp6fwr0000gn/T//RtmpenMXgG/downloaded_packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(clinfun)\n\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021, \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"increasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 297.5, p-value = 0.0072\nalternative hypothesis: increasing\n\n\nWhile the p-value produced was moderately strong, we will not perform an ANOVA permutation test to further validate the significance of these associations:\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation Test\nN &lt;- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 4.561629 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0252 \n\n\nCode\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yields a p-value of 0.0252, which is statistically stronger than the p-value yielded by the Kruskal-Wallis test.

In other words, the data supports the presence of a relationship between abortion policy strictness and infant mortality rates across U.S. states.\nTo further explore these differences, pairwise comparisons using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction were conducted to assess which specific groups differ significantly. The results indicate that no significant differences were observed between adjacent policy groups (e.g., “most protective” vs. “very protective” or “restrictive” vs. “very restrictive”), with all p-values ≥ 1.00 in these cases. However, the following comparisons involving the “most restrictive” category stand out: 1) the comparison between “most restrictive” and “most protective” yielded a p-value of 0.61 and the comparison between “most restrictive” and “very protective” produced a p-value of 0.17.

    "text": "Unfortunately, it is difficult find reliable and accessible data on complications and unsafe abortions. Several factors may contribute to this lack of information. Initially, data was sought for miscarriage rates variation by state, how unsafe abortion rates evolved over time, illegal abortion rates, and data on women whose lives were endangered by the inability to access safe abortion services. However, these datasets either do not exist or are difficult to locate.\nMany elements might be responsible for this dearth of information. It may, for instance, be difficult or unrealistic to report on all miscarriages. Furthermore, there are stringent regulations surrounding all research done on pregnant women for obvious reasons. Data on unsafe or illegal abortions might not exists because these procedures may go unreported. However, the absence of these data sets is telling in and of itself, and is an issue for women’s health and public health on the whole regardless of political perspective or affiliation."

    "text": "Abortion is a unique and contentious political issue in the United States. In 1973, the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v.

This reversal intensified the political divide, with Democrats and liberals typically advocating for abortion rights, while Republicans and conservatives strongly opposed them. Despite this polarized political landscape, public opinion surveys consistently show that a majority of Americans support the right to abortion. For example, a 2022 Pew Research study highlights widespread support for abortion access across various demographics (Adkins et al. 2024).\nAbortion policy now varies significantly across states, reflecting the political leanings of their governments.

    "text": "Context & Case Studies\n\nSince the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, numerous stories have emerged illustrating the devastating impact of abortion bans on women and children’s health. For example, a study by Stevenson (2021) projected a 7% increase in maternal mortality in the first year following widespread abortion bans, with the rate rising to 23% in the subsequent year (Stevenson 2021). These findings highlight the immediate and severe health risks associated with restrictive abortion policies. Notably, vulnerable populations, including racial minorities and those with low socioeconomic status, are disproportionately affected.\nThe effects of the Dobbs decision have also had less direct negative impacts on women. Adkins et. al found an 11% increase in children placed in the foster care system in states that instituted TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws (Adkins et al. 2024). Wallace et. al. find a 3.4% increase in the likelihood that women fall victim to domestic partner violence with each additional implementation of a TRAP law (Wallace et al. 2024). These findings illustrate how abortion policy has ripple associations beyond immediate impacts on women’s health.\nWhile maternal mortality is one critical measure, it is only one piece of the larger picture. Well-being encompasses a wide range of factors, including access to prenatal care, economic stability, and the mental health of mothers and families. These indicators often vary widely across states, driven by differences in healthcare infrastructure, economic resources, and social support."

is a sloped relationship between whether or not a state has mandatory abortion policy and the degree of their abortion policy restrictiveness/protectiveness. The slope coefficients and the visualization indicate that the slope between the abortion policy level and having parental leave legislation (y=1) gets more positive as the policy level gets more protective regarding abortion. This indicates that states that have abortion policies that are protective for women are more likely to also have mandatory parental leave policy than states with restrictive abortion policy. This is important, because it means that the states that choose to make abortion less accessible and therefore force women to have babies, also foster conditions that make it incredibly difficult for women to have babies. This highlights a lack of care for mothers’ wellbeing and financial stability in states with restrictive abortion rights.\n\n\nParental Leave Job Protection by Abortion Policy\n\n\nCode\n# reorder the

sample sizes that were too small, we performed exact logistic regression to account for small sample sizes and separation. The exact logistic regression yielded a p-value of 0.03880713, indicating that there is significant evidence to suggest a linear relationship between job protection policy and the degree of restrictiveness to protectiveness of a state’s abortion policy.\nFrom the coefficients and the visualization, we can see that states with more protective abortion measures are more likely to have policy guaranteeing job protection for parents when they take paternal leave to care for their child(ren). This reveals that states that do not have abortion policy concurrently establish conditions that make having a child more difficult. This is problematic, because if the state creates conditions so that women are forced to have babies instead of being able to access abortion or contraceptive rights and then they have a baby, they face the jeopardy of losing their job and income with no protection.\n\n\nPercentage of Employed Women per State by Abortion Policy\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_women_working by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 13.889, df = 6, p-value = 0.0309\n\n\nCode\n# If Kruskal-Wallis is significant, run pairwise Wilcoxon tests\npairwise.wilcox.test(df$percent_women_working, \n                     df$abortion_policies,\n                     p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n    Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction \n\ndata:  df$percent_women_working and df$abortion_policies \n\n                              most restrictive very restrictive restrictive\nvery restrictive              1.00             -                -          \nrestrictive                   0.31             1.00             -          \nsome restrictions/protections 1.00             1.00             1.00       \nprotective                    0.13             1.00             1.00       \nvery protective               1.00             1.00             1.00       \nmost protective               1.00             1.00             1.00       \n                              some restrictions/protections protective\nvery restrictive              -                             -         \nrestrictive                   -                             -         \nsome restrictions/protections -                             -         \nprotective                    1.00                          -         \nvery protective               1.00                          1.00      \nmost protective               1.00                          1.00      \n                              very protective\nvery restrictive              -              \nrestrictive                   -              \nsome restrictions/protections -              \nprotective                    -              \nvery protective               -              \nmost protective               1.00           \n\nP value adjustment method: bonferroni \n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                              levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                         \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                         \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Employed\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Employed by Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test yields a significant p-value of 0.0309, allowing us to suggest that there is truly a difference in the mean number of women working in at least one level of abortion policy.

This is interesting, because only this group within levels of protective abortion policies stands out as having lower female employment rates.\n\n\nCode\noptions(repos = c(CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\ninstall.packages(\"clinfun\")\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/zl/mwx636ts1pbc006v4wqp6fwr0000gn/T//RtmppaDaK2/downloaded_packages\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(clinfun)\n\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$percent_women_working, \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"decreasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 395.5, p-value = 0.0135\nalternative hypothesis: decreasing\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation test\nn_perm &lt;- 10000 \n\n# observed F-statistic\nobserved_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F &lt;- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\nset.seed(6547) \nperm_F &lt;- numeric(n_perm)\n\nfor (i in 1:n_perm) {\n  # permute the response variable\n  permuted_data &lt;- df\n  permuted_data$percent_women_working &lt;- sample(permuted_data$percent_women_working)\n  \n  # ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova &lt;- aov(percent_women_working ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] &lt;- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# p-value\np_value &lt;- mean(perm_F &gt;= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n\n\nObserved F-statistic: 2.588987 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0296 \n\n\nCode\n# visualization\nhist(perm_F, breaks = 30, main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", xlab = \"F-statistic\")\nabline(v = observed_F, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test of the ANOVA test further confirms that this data has a significant p-value which indicates evidence to suggest that the mean percentage of employed women in at least one abortion policy group is different from the rest, but as noted above with the visualization, it does not necessarily mean that there is a “linear” relationship between more protective abortion policies and higher female employment.\n\n\nCode\ndf$abortion_policies &lt;- factor(df$abortion_policies, levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_working, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean % Women Working\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Working by Abortion Policy\")"

The boxplot visualization reveals that postpartum depression screening is the highest in states with the most protective abortion policies, where approximately 94% of women are screened. The lowest percentage of women screened for postpartum depression is in the states that are the most restrictive. This suggests that states that prioritize screening for mothers’ mental health are also the most considerate of abortion rights, whereas states that chose to implement more restrictive abortion policies already do not prioritize widespread screening for mothers’ postpartum depression.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_who_received_a_postpartum_depression_screening_2021, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"%\", title = \"Mean Percentage of Women Recieved Postpartum Depression Screening\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence by Abortion Policy\n\n\nCode\n# Kruskal-Wallis test\nkruskal.test(percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021 by abortion_policies\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 10.88, df = 6, p-value = 0.09215\n\n\nCode\npairwise.wilcox.test(df$percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021, \n                     df$abortion_policies,\n                     p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\")\n\n\n\n    Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction \n\ndata:  df$percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021 and df$abortion_policies \n\n                              most protective very protective protective\nvery protective               1.00            -               -         \nprotective                    1.00            1.00            -         \nsome restrictions/protections 1.00            1.00            1.00      \nrestrictive                   1.00            1.00            1.00      \nvery restrictive              1.00            1.00            1.00      \nmost restrictive              1.00            0.58            0.84      \n                              some restrictions/protections restrictive\nvery protective               -                             -          \nprotective                    -                             -          \nsome restrictions/protections -                             -          \nrestrictive                   1.00                          -          \nvery restrictive              1.00                          1.00       \nmost restrictive              1.00                          1.00       \n                              very restrictive\nvery protective               -               \nprotective                    -               \nsome restrictions/protections -               \nrestrictive                   -               \nvery restrictive              -               \nmost restrictive              1.00            \n\nP value adjustment method: bonferroni \n\n\nCode\n# accompanying visualization\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Experiencing Domestic Violence\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Experiencing Intimate Partner Violence by Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis Test and the boxplot visualization to not provide any evidence to suggest that there is a relationship between the prevalence of women experiencing domestic violence and the state’s abortion policy.\n\n\nCode\n# Run Jonckheere-Terpstra test\njt_test &lt;- jonckheere.test(df$percent_women_experiencing_intimate_partner_violence_2021, \n                          as.numeric(df$abortion_policies), \n                          alternative=\"increasing\",\n                          nperm = 10000)\nprint(jt_test)\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere-Terpstra test\n\ndata:  \nJT = 298.5, p-value = 0.0077\nalternative hypothesis: increasing"

    "text": "Statistical methods & models\nTo analyze the association between various health and wellness conditions in each state in 2022 or earlier and the eventual implemented level of abortion policy post Dobbs decision, we used four hypothesis testing methods. Our variable of interest (the abortion policy level) is a multinomial categorical variable, but it has many limiting characteristics that violate assumptions for many common baseline methods, such as ANOVA and Chi-square. The sample sizes (the count of observations in each level of abortion policy) were very uneven, and some sample sizes were extremely small (with a total count of 2), which violates the assumptions of some methods. In particular, this violates Chi-square’s assumption that the expected count frequency for each variable combination is at least 5. This also violates ANOVA’s assumptions of homoscedasticity and the normality of residuals, because one abortion policy level was composed of two states, while there were sixteen states with very restrictive abortion policies. Therefore, we made sure to deploy statistical tests that were appropriate for our small and uneven data. These tests and their use cases are described below.\nFor assessing the association between numerical variables and abortion policy level:\n\nPermutation-based ANOVA test\n\nThis is a non-parametric, robust alternative to traditional ANOVA that evaluates differences in means between levels of a categorical variable without requiring the assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances.\nNull hypothesis → the means across all levels of abortion policy are equal.\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one group mean is significantly different from the rest.\n\nKruskal-Wallis\n\nThis is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether there are significant differences between the medians of two or more independent groups by comparing the ranks of data across groups to test for differences rather than relying on raw data values. This test also permits data that does not meet the assumptions for ANOVA.\nNull hypothesis → The medians across all levels of abortion policy are equal.\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one group median is significantly different from the rest.\n\n\nFor assessing the association between binary variables and abortion policy level:\n\nFisher’s Exact Test\n\nThis is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a contingency table. It is an appropriate alternative to the Chi-square test when sample size assumption, which states that the expected frequencies in all contingency table cells must be greater than 5, is violated. Our data naturally violates this assumption, making Fisher’s Exact Test a suitable method for assessing differences among our small abortion policy levels.\nNull hypothesis → There is no association between the binary variable and the abortion policy.\nAlternative hypothesis → There is an association between the binary variable and the abortion policy\n\nExact Logistic Regression\n\nThis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary outcome (dependent variable) and an independent variable, particularly when traditional logistic regression assumptions are violated. When sample sizes are very small, traditional logistic regression may produce unreliable results due to large standard errors. This test calculates exact p-values for parameter estimates rather than relying on asymptotic approximations.\nNull hypothesis → The abortion policy has no effect on the probability of the binary outcome\nAlternative hypothesis → At least one level of abortion policy significantly affects the probability of the binary outcome\n\n\nRelevant and insightful data visualizations were also provided alongside these tests to illuminate the characteristics of the data and provide additional information on the differences among abortion policy levels. Please see the Results section for our statistical testing outcomes."
